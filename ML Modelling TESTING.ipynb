The model will be optimized\nfor the root mean squared error metric (tracked as val_rmse in MLflow experiments).\n\nYou can track the completed trials in the MLflow experiment

can be edited to tweak the setup, add hyperparameters and re-run the trials.\nAll re-run notebooks will log the trials under the same experiment.\nGenerated notebooks contain instructions to load models from your favorite trials.\n**********************************************************************************************************\n\n\r  0%|          | 0/200 [00:00&lt;?, ?trial/s, best

The best way to avoid this problem is to infer the model schema based on a realistic data sample (training dataset) that includes missing values. Alternatively, you can declare integer columns as doubles (float64) whenever these columns may have missing values. See `Handling Integers With Missing Values &lt;https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#handling-integers-with-missing-values&gt;`_ for more details.\n  outputs = _infer_schema(model_output) if model_output is not None else None\n</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# last
